            <h3>Clovis High School & CART</h3>

At the moment I am taking AP Environmental Science, and I will also be enrolled in AP Computer Science. I also attend Web Application Development or mainly known as Web App. Here we learn how to code and the fundamental of coding a website.  </p>
            <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
            <p>I like to take close up photos of objects. I've also used many editing programs such as Photoshop and Adobe After Effects. From time to time I will edit videos on Adobe After Effects and Sony Vegas Pro 12. Currently, I also enjoy learning new coding languages on my own such as JQuery.  </p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I know how to talk in both English and Spanish since I grew up an household where I was mainly talk to in Spanish.  I am currently a student over the the Center of Advanced Research and Technology in the lab Web Development. In This class we learn how to code using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and soon PHP. A brief summary what this different coding languages do is HTML  is the basics of the website, the skeleton. While CSS is used to give the website color and aesthetics to make the website look cleaner. CSS also allows the use of basic animations. While JavaScript is a more advanced language that is used to give websites functionality. It allows the creator to set multiple functions for certain elements.   On my spare time for hobbies I will occasionally play video games but usually I  like to take pictures of random objects and friends then edit them in Photoshop. Usually I will edit the photo to make it seem more professional such as blurring out the background and changing the contrasts and saturation. While other times, I will make the photo funny by making the person have a big head or tiny face.  I've also  done video editing in Adobe After Effects and Sony Vegas Pro 12. It's been a while but I have also used Cinema 4D to make 3D models and effects. I have not had any prior job experiences but I have helped my step-dad build a fence 200ft wide. In addition I've helped him build a shed in the back and a patio roof. </p>
